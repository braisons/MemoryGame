#1. Given two points p1 and p2, calculate
#   the distance between them.

p1 = (3,5)
p2 = (6,7)

x1, y1 = p1[0], p1[1]
x2, y2 = p2[0], p2[1]

distance = ((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)**0.5
print('The distance = ', distance)

# 2. Using the formula for a line,
#    calculate the value of y if
#    the slope = 1.33, b = 2, and
#    the value of x = 7

slope = 1.33
b = 2
x = 9

y = slope * x + b
print('y is equal to ' , y)
